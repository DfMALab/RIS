# Logic

Logic ('possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative') is the systematic study of the forms of inference, i.e. the relations that lead to the acceptance of one proposition (the conclusion) on the basis of a set of other propositions (premises). More broadly, logic is the analysis and appraisal of arguments. [[1][1]]
